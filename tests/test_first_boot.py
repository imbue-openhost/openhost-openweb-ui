"""First-boot behavior: the OpenHost owner should land directly on Open WebUI's
main page, with Open WebUI's own user setup / login bypassed.

The mock router fronts the container and injects ``X-OpenHost-Is-Owner: true``
on every request, just as the real OpenHost router does for the authenticated
owner. So simply pointing a browser at ``stack.url`` reproduces what the owner
sees on a brand-new deployment.
