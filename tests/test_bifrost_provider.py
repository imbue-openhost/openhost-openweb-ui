"""The Bifrost gateway should be wired up as an Open WebUI model provider
automatically, with no manual connection setup.

On first boot openhost_start.sh seeds Open WebUI's OpenAI connection to point at
the local mitmproxy (127.0.0.1:9000), which fronts the gateway's service
interface. Here we assert Open WebUI actually holds that connection.

The test harness's mock router does not simulate cross-app service calls, so a
true end-to-end "list models from Bifrost" check needs a live instance with both
apps installed; this verifies the configuration side.
